other units. Note this does _not_ include any actual Bible texts.

- **Documentation** may *eventually* arrive at <https://clear-bible.github.io/Biblelib/>

An earlier version of this code was developed while the author was at
[Faithlife](https://faithlife.com) and published at
https://github.com/Faithlife/python-BibleLib. This code has been
completely rewritten, however, and so is free of any copyright
restrictions.
