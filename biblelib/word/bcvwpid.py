"""Manage BCVWP identifiers for words and morphology.

Technically, this should be called BBCCCVVVWWWP format, but that's a
mouthful.

BCVWP = Book, Chapter, Verse, Word, Part as sequential numerical
indices. This is typically encoded as BBCCCVVVWWWP, but there are
variants: sometimes the Part index is omitted. Individual Bible
editions might have different text indexed in different ways, so you
should not assume that BCVWP value for one Bible maps directly to another.

>>> from biblelib.word import BCVID, BCVWPID
>>> bcv = BCVID("41004003")
>>> bcv.book_ID
"41"
>>> bcv.chapter_ID
"004"
>>> bcv.verse_ID
"003"
>>> bcv < BCVID("41005001")
True
>>> BCVID.fromusfm("Gen 3:16")
BCVID("01003016")
>>> BCVID.fromlogos("bible.1.2.3")
BCVID("01002003")

Similar things work with BCID (book and chapter) and BCVWPID.

ToDo:
- add a containment hierarchy:
    - BID().includes(BCVID()) -> bool
    - BID().includes(BCVWPID()) (because of transitivity)
    - maybe just treat this internally as substring matching?
- rewrite with pydantic?
- one set of `from_X` methods that return the right kind of instance
  depending on the number of characters
- figure out whether this is a case for composition (rather than
  subclassing)
- methods for rendering in various formats
