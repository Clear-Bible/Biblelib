and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

## Acknowledgements

* Many ideas for Biblelib came from my work on [Logos Bible
  Software](https://www.logos.com/) at
  [Faithlife](https://faithlife.com) and the need for our team to
  process Bible data. This is all new code, however, and freely
  reusable without restriction.
* The `books` metadata incorporates standards developed by [Clear
  Bible](https://clear.bible), [Open Scripture Information Standard
  (OSIS)](https://crosswire.org/osis/), [Unified Standard Format
  Markers (USFM)](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/index.html), and
  [Logos Bible Software](https://www.logos.com/).
* Pericope divisions and headings are taken from the [Lexham English
  Bible](http://www.lexhamenglishbible.com/) and used under the terms
  of [License Information for the Lexham English
  Bible](https://lexhampress.com/LEB-License). Commercial reuse of
  this data may require special arrangements with Lexham Press to
  inform them of the number of copies: contact them at
  copyright@lexhampress.com for details.
* The word-level mappings between Hebrew Bible versions in
  `words/mappings` come from ...
* The word-level mappings between Greek Bible versions come from the
  work of:
    * [WWU Institut für neutestamentliche
      Textforschung (the Institute for New Testament Textual
      Research)](http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/index_en.shtml) and

      Graece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Testamentum_Graece)
