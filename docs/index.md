## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

## Acknowledgements

* Many ideas for Biblelib came from my work on [Logos Bible
  Software](https://www.logos.com/) at
  [Faithlife](https://faithlife.com) and the need for our team to
  process Bible data. This is all new code, however, and freely
  reusable without restriction.
* The `books` metadata incorporates standards developed by [Open Scripture
  Information Standard (OSIS)](https://crosswire.org/osis/),
  [Unified Standard Format Markers
  (USFM)](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/index.html), and [Logos Bible
  Software](https://www.logos.com/).
