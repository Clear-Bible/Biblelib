## Books

### Logos Identifiers

`Book.logosID` identifies Bible books according to the format used by
Logos Bible Software. This is an integer index, starting with 1 for
Genesis, with deuterocanonical books ordered after the Old Testament
(so the index for Matthew is 61, not 40).

### USFM Identifiers

[Unified Standard Format Markers
3.0.0](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/index.html) defines three
attributes for identifying a Bible book:

* Number: a two-character string (not actually a number, though the
  most common books use digits). For the early Old Testament books,
  this is zero-padded (so Genesis is "01").
* Identifier:
* English Name:
