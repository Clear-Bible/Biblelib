# Word-level Mappings

## BBCCCVVVWWWSSSL (id15 format)

## BBCCCVVVWWWSSSL (id15 format)

Randall's explanation of the 15-character ID format:

> the nodeId: A 15-digit unique id in the format BBCCCVVVWWWSSSL
where
BB => zero-padded book
CCC => zero-padded chapter
VVV => zero-padded verse
WWW represents the beginning position (the Nth word) of a node/sub-tree
SSS represents the SPAN of a node (how many words it covers)
L (Level) is used to distinguish nodes which have the same span (in cases of non-branching nodes)
